Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Implement room editor:
	- Drag and drop into room div:
		- First image dropped is automatically set as the background
		- If there is a background, all future images are assumed to be buttons:
			- Create parameters in inspector
			- Set image to the dropped image
			- Set top-left position to be the mouse position when it was dropped
			- Ignore multiple files, only take the first one?
	- Zoom in/out buttons for the room
	- Restrict text editors to specific characters (no spaces for button IDs,
	  only numbers for positions/sizes, no spaces for URLs)
	- Update button position, size when changing left/top/width/height in
	  inspector
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
