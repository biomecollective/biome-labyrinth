Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- Better name!
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Implement room editor:
	- Add button parameters to inspector when a button is loaded
	- ...and remove them if a button is deleted
	- Drag and drop into room div:
		- First image dropped is automatically set as the background
		- If there is a background, all future images are assumed to be buttons:
			- Create parameters in inspector
			- Set image to the dropped image
			- Set top-left position to be the mouse position when it was dropped
			- Ignore multiple files, only take the first one?
	- Zoom in/out buttons for the room
