Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Room editor:
	- Switch to mouse move instead of drag for dragging buttons?
		- Would skip the glitchy 2nd copy of the image
	- Draggable handles for buttons (scale + rotate)
	- Dragging buttons does not really work when the room is zoomed out
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
- Better css for things like tooltips, room editor inspector
