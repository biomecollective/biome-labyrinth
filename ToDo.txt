Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Implement room editor:
	- Implement draggable button in room
		- Img with src set to button image
		- Positioned top left in % relative to parent div
		- When added calculate size in % relative to parent div size
		- Responds to drag events to set position
			- Update inspector when moved
	- Drag and drop into room div:
		- First image dropped is automatically set as the background
		- If there is a background, all future images are assumed to be buttons:
			- Create parameters in inspector
			- Set image to the dropped image
			- Set top-left position to be the mouse position when it was dropped
			- Ignore multiple files, only take the first one?
	- Zoom in/out buttons for the room
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
