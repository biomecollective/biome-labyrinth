Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Room editor:
	- Update button position, size when changing left/top/width/height in
	  inspector
	- Switch to mouse move instead of drag for dragging buttons?
		- Would skip the glitchy 2nd copy of the image
	- Draggable handles for buttons (scale + rotate)
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
- Update title with current room name
- Better css for things like tooltips, room editor inspector
- Add error message if navigating to a room that doesn't exist
