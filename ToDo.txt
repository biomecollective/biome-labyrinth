Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Implement room editor:
	- Zoom in/out buttons for the room
	- Restrict text editors to specific characters (no spaces for button IDs,
	  only numbers for positions/sizes, no spaces for URLs)
	- Update button position, size when changing left/top/width/height in
	  inspector
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
- Update title with current room name
