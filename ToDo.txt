Biome Gallery 2 ToDo
--------------------
- What license are we using?
- Support background image for body?
- Alt text for buttons now we're using background-image?
	- Not sure this is possible; but the tooltips should function similarly?
- Room editor:
	- Switch to mouse move instead of drag for dragging buttons?
		- Would skip the glitchy 2nd copy of the image
		- Would (I think) also fix the weird drag behaviour on zoom, and when
		  dragging a button over another
	- Draggable handles for buttons (scale + rotate)
	- Dragging buttons does not really work when the room is zoomed out
	- Only room div should have scrollbars when background image is bigger than
	  window; inspector should be separate
	- Confirm when leaving page if you've not saved your changes
- Tooltips persist on mobile after clicking buttons
- Better css for things like tooltips, room editor inspector
- Regarding the BDS chat at the meeting, should we move away from github?
	- And if so, what alternatives offer easy hosting, automatically deployed on
	  push?
- Add favicon
